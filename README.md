## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use Apify actors to scrape public Instagram data.
   - Extract profiles, posts, followers, and engagement metrics.

2. **Profile Analysis**:
   - Calculate engagement rates and influence scores.
   - Detect fake followers using a FastAPI-hosted ML model.

3. **Network Analysis**:
   - Generate visual representations of follower relationships.

4. **Commenter Analysis**:
   - Extract usernames of commenters from posts.
   - Analyze their profiles using machine learning.

## üåê Usage

### Analyze Profiles
1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. Enter an Instagram username to analyze.
3. View comprehensive analytics including:
   - Profile statistics (followers, following, posts).
   - Engagement metrics (likes/comments per post).
   - Fake follower percentage (ML-powered detection).
   - Network graph visualization.

### Leaderboard
1. Navigate to `/leaderboard/view` to see top influencers.
2. Filter by category using the dropdown menu.
3. Sort by influence score, engagement rate, or follower count.

### Categories

## üß† Machine Learning Model

# üö® Fake Followers Detection API

This project provides a REST API that estimates the percentage of fake followers for Instagram profiles based solely on followers' metadata. It is built using **FastAPI**, a high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

---

## üîç Overview

Instagram users and influencers often attract fake followers‚Äîeither bots or inactive accounts. This project uses machine learning and heuristics to detect such fake followers from profile and follower data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. üì¶ Data Collection
- Follower metadata is gathered from Instagram-like sources via tools like **Apify** or scrapers.
- Typical data per follower includes:
  - `username`
  - `followersCount`
  - `followsCount`
  - `postsCount`

### 2. üß† Model (ML-based Classifier)
- A machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier or XGBoost) was trained on a labeled dataset containing real and fake accounts.
- The features used include:
  - Number of posts
  - Followers/following count
  - Profile privacy
  - Presence of a profile picture
  - Bio length
  - Username length and numeric patterns

### 3. üîó API Endpoint
- The trained model and/or heuristic logic is served using FastAPI.
- The user sends a JSON of followers to the `/predict_fake_followers` endpoint.
- The API processes the data and returns:
  - Total followers analyzed
  - Estimated fake follower percentage

## üìà Influence Score Calculation

The influence score is calculated using a weighted formula:
1. Engagement rate (35%)
2. Authenticity (25%)
3. Content quality (25%)
4. Reach (15%)
