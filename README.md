The fake follower detection system uses a machine learning model hosted on FastAPI. It analyzes:
- Username characteristics (length, digits).
- Profile completeness (bio length, profile picture).
- Following/follower ratios.
- Posting frequency and patterns.

The model returns a percentage score indicating the likelihood of fake followers in an account.

## üìà Influence Score Calculation

The influence score is calculated using a weighted formula:
1. Engagement rate (35%)
2. Authenticity (25%)
3. Content quality (25%)
4. Reach (15%)
